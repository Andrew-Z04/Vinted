# Hello Vinted

Here is my Vinted assignment.

I was writing my code in Java using IntelliJ IDEA.

I chose Java because I felt that it would be the best for the way I was going to code it.I have tried to adjust my code to fill all requirements for code structure.

I hope I have adjusted my code properly, considering that the code guide was in Ruby, which differs significantly from Java, and not all changes could be made.

The only libraries I was using were for specific variable creation and handling, functions for reading from a file, and exception handling.

I have attached a folder with a full project.
In the "src" folder, there are 3 main files. "Main.java" is the main program, "Ship" is the class for the shipment details, and "input.txt" is for input data.

I hope my program will meet your expectations.
